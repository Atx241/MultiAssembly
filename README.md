# MultiAssembly
The first implementation of multiplayer in Aviassembly! To install, download and run the file [here](https://github.com/Atx241/MultiAssembly/releases/download/1.0.0/installer.exe). I haven't implemented fuselage loading yet, and the mod is probably riddled with bugs, so make sure that you go to the [issues tab](https://github.com/Atx241/MultiAssembly/issues) to report bugs.
